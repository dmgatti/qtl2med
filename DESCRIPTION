Description: Given a quantitative trait locus (qtl), the data that produced
    the qtl peak and gene expression data for the same set of subjects, ask
	whether the expression of any of the genes explains a significant part
	of the variance. We do this by regressing the phenotype on covariates
	and the genotype at the QTL peak and comparing this to a model that adds
	the expression of one gene. When we do this across the genome, we often
	find several genes that reduce the LOD score. These genes are candidate
	mediators that may be influencing the phenotype.
